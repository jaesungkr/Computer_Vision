# Computer_Vision

This coursework aims to implement the sparse optical flow for tracking and to improve optical
flow or tracking results. Through this process, I can get more experience in implementing
computer vision programs, plus obtain an understanding of sparse optical flow and computer
vision in general. In this project, I built the Lucas-Kanade optical flow program, plus the
Gunnar Farneback dense optical flow program to help to understand the strength and weakness
of the sparse optical flow. Both implementations were using OpenCV library on major
functions like cv2.goodFeaturesToTrack() or cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK. Moreover, there are
efforts of improving tracking results, and those extra implementations on sparse optical flow
are done without any cv2-library. Since this coursework more aim to implement a sparse optical
flow program, this report also aims more to explain sparse optical flow functionalities.
